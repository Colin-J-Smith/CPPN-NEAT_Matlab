# CPPN-NEAT

To run:

2) To run with default settings used in this project press F5 or the "Run" button.


Brief Comments:
This code is slightly modified version of the Matlab HyperNEAT implementation by Kenneth Stanley which is included as a zip filein it's unmodified form. A dynamic siulator by Travis Hainsworth was also modified to accomodate a second material with added volumetric actuation.
