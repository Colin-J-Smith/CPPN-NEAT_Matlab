    save_flag=1; %if set to 1, will save population, generation, innovation_record and species_record to neatsave.mat at every generation (default option)
    % upshot of this is: the settings above will start with initial population (of your specification) and save all important structures at every generation, so if your workstation crashes or you have to interrupt evolution, you can, at next startup, simply set the load flag to 1 and continue where you have left off. 
    % Please note, however, that only changing structures are saved, the parameters in this section will not be saved, so you have to ensure that you use the same parameters when using a saved version of evolution as when you created this saved version!
    % Also note that all variables are saved in binary matlab format, so file is only readable by matlab. If you want to look at some of the values stored in this file, load it in matlab, then you can access the saved values
